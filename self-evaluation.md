# DashboardApp - Self Evaluation

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.2.

## Half-page summary of the submission - the good, the bad, and the ugly
This assignment has been a great learning oppportunity for me. The good part was the amazing high fidelity design provided. Many core concepts of CSS and javascript and the UI development were tested. The most interesting part for me was learning about the chart.js library.
The bad part was that I fell short of time in implementing the chart.js library.

## Be self-critical of your code!
The code is modular and divided into feature modules. Lazy loading has been implemented for better performance. Sign-in and Sign- up functionality could be more enhanced and implementation of graphs could be completed.

## What could be done better if given more time?
There are 3 points which I could have done better if more time was there:
* Graphs could be completed using Graph.js.
* A responsive application could have been built which would be suitable for mobile devices too.
* Code Refactoring could be done.
  
## Rate yourself on the technologies used in the assignment out of 10!
